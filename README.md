### History
The product that became Live Writer was originally created by a small, super-talented team of engineers including 
JJ Allaire, Joe Cheng, Charles Teague, and Spike Washburn. The team was acquired by Microsoft 
in 2006 and organized with the Spaces team. Becky Pezely joined the team and over time, the team grew and shipped
many popular releases of Windows Live Writer.

As Microsoft was planning for the version of Windows Live that would coincide with Windows 8 operating system
release, the teams that built the Windows Live client apps for Windows were encouraged to focus on building a 
smaller set of Windows 8 apps designed to work well with both traditional PC input mechanisms and touch. 
With the rise of micro-blogging platforms and other forms of sharing, eventually this team decided to conclude
their work on Windows Live Writer with Windows Live Writer 2012.

Even though there was no active development, Windows Live Writer continued to be a favorite tool of a passionate
community of Windows PC users for authoring, editing, and publishing blog posts. Data from WordPress.com at the 
time suggested that Open Live Writer (even two years after active development ended) was the #1 app for authoring
a blog post to WordPress.com from a Windows PC. 

A few employees at Microsoft took an interest in reviving Live Writer as an open source project in their
spare time.  By January 2015, a group of about a half-dozen engineers interested in spending some of their
volunteer time to help release an updated version of Live Writer had found each other and began work on getting
this open source fork of Live Writer formed and ready to ship. In December 2015 Microsoft donated the code
to the .NET Foundation and this passionate group of volunteer engineers rapidly assembled the first open source
version.
