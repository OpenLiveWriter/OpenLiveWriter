### Test Plan Procedures
* Go to the contributors repository - for example if I am the contributor, go to my repositories and get a copy, either by downloading the zip file or by cloning
* Build and run the code.  See https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/wiki/Building,-Testing,-and-Debugging
* If you don't need to look at the code, use this procedure;
  * Go to a pull request
  * Scroll down to "All check have passed" and click on "Show all checks"
  * Click on 'Details' link next to 'AppVeyor build succeeded'
  * You can see the output of the build if it succeeded, click on 'Artifacts'
  * Find OpenLiveWiterSetup.exe
  * Download that and run it to install OpenLiveWriter.
* Attempt to recreate the bug
* Sanity Test -- I am creating checklists for sanity tests.  Test as many individual things as you possibly can.
* When you find a problem, document it in the pull request.
